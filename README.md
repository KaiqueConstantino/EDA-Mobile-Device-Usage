Mobile Device Usage Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📄 Project Description
This project conducts an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset focused on mobile device usage patterns and user behavior classification. The dataset contains 700 samples, capturing details such as app usage time, battery consumption, and data usage. The analysis aims to provide insights into user behavior and identify usage patterns based on demographic and device characteristics.

📊 Key Dataset Features
User ID: Unique identifier for each user.
Device Model: Model of the smartphone.
Operating System: Operating system of the device (iOS or Android).
App Usage Time: Daily time spent on mobile applications (minutes).
Screen On Time: Average daily active screen time (hours).
Battery Drain: Daily battery consumption (mAh).
Number of Apps Installed: Total number of apps installed on the device.
Data Usage: Daily mobile data consumption (MB).
Age: Age of the user.
Gender: User's gender (Male or Female).
User Behavior Class: Classification of user behavior based on usage patterns (1 to 5).

🎯 Project Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
To explore and understand mobile usage patterns across various user profiles.
To analyze how factors like age, gender, and operating system influence user behavior.
To categorize usage into different classes for future predictive models and machine learning applications.

🛠️ Libraries Used
Pandas and Numpy: For data manipulation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For visualizations and graphical analysis.
Sklearn: For preprocessing and feature engineering.

🔍 Analysis Overview
Descriptive Analysis: Examined statistics such as mean, median, and distribution across the data.
Visualizations: Scatter plots, histograms, and boxplots provided insights into usage patterns.
Segmentation by Category: Analyzed behaviors by age group, operating system, and other relevant features.
